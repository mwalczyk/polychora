## Description

### Projections

After seeing videos of [Miegakure](http://miegakure.com/) gameplay, I became very interested in the idea of 4-dimensional rendering. It turns out that there are several ways to visualize higher dimensional objects. Perhaps the simplest method involves a projection from 4D to 3D. This is similar to how "traditional" 3D engines render objects to a 2D display surface (your screen). A 4D -> 3D projection can either be a perspective or parallel (orthographic) projection. However, instead of projecting objects onto a flat plane (as is the case in a 3D -> 2D projection), we project our 4-dimensional objects "onto" a 3-dimensional cuboid (in this case, the unit cube centered at the origin). From here, we simply perform the 3D -> 2D projection that we are used to.

Most people are familiar with this form of visualization. When a 4D -> 3D perspective projection is applied to the 8-cell (also known as the hypercube or [tesseract](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tesseract)), the result is the familiar animation of an "outer" cube with a smaller, nested "inner" cube that appears to unfold itself via a series of 4-dimensional plane rotations. The reason why this inner cube appears smaller is because it is "further away" in the 4th dimension (the `w`-axis of our 4D coordinate system). If you are interested in this form of visualization, I highly recommend Steven Hollasch's [thesis](http://hollasch.github.io/ray4/Four-Space_Visualization_of_4D_Objects.html#chapter4), titled _Four-Space Visualization of 4D Objects_.

### Slicing

A different way to visualize 4-dimensional objects is via a "slicing" procedure, which produces a series of 3-dimensional cross-sections of the full 4-dimensional shape. This is analogous to cutting 3D polyhedra with a plane (think MRI scans). Luckily, much of the math carries over to 4D. In order to facilitate this process, meshes in `polychora` are represented by a "shell" of tetrahedra. 

Over the course of this research project, I have explored 2 different ways of generating polychora. Currently, shapes are generated in a fully procedural manner using combinatorics and [QHull](http://www.qhull.org/), a library for computing n-dimensional convex hulls. The coordinates of the vertices of all uniform + regular polychora are known and can be calculated via a set of even/odd permutations and changes-of-sign. For example, the 120-cell can be generated via the following "permutation table" (taken from the amazing catalog available at [Eusebeia](http://eusebeia.dyndns.org/4d/120-cell)):

```
All permutations and changes-of-sign of:

  (2, 2, 0, 0)
  (âˆš5, 1, 1, 1)
  (Ï†, Ï†, Ï†, Ï†âˆ’2)
  (Ï†2, Ï†âˆ’1, Ï†âˆ’1, Ï†âˆ’1)

Together with all even permutations and changes-of-sign of:

  (Ï†2, Ï†âˆ’2, 1, 0)
  (âˆš5, Ï†âˆ’1, Ï†, 0)
  (2, 1, Ï†, Ï†âˆ’1)

where Ï† is the Golden Ratio.

```

I wrote a C++ header file for enumerating such permutations, together with help from the C++ standard template library and a header file from Eusebeia (for generating only the even permutations). Once the vertices are generated, we can pass them to QHull's convex hull algorithm. Enabling the `Qt` flag results in a list of simplical facets, which can be directly passed into the slicing procedure.

Previously, polychora were generated in a more ad-hoc manner, using a variety of modified "shape files" that I found on the internet (mostly from Paul Bourke's [website](http://paulbourke.net/geometry/hyperspace/)). You can find the corresponding code in an [older, less polished version](https://github.com/mwalczyk/four) of this project, which was also written in Rust. The advantage of this approach was that it gave access to all of the connectivity information of each polychoron: vertices, edges, faces, and cells. However, because the resulting facets weren't necessarily tetrahedral, I had to algorithmically "tetrahedralize" each mesh before rendering.

Tetrahedralization in 4-space is similar to triangulation in 3-space. In particular, [any 3D convex polyhedron can be decomposed into tetrahedrons](https://mathoverflow.net/questions/7647/break-polyhedron-into-tetrahedron) by first subdividing its faces into triangles. Next, we pick a vertex from the polyhedron (any vertex will do). We connect all of the other face triangles to the chosen vertex to form a set of tetrahedra (obviously, ignoring faces that contain the chosen vertex). This is not necessarily the "minimal tetrahedral decomposition" of the polyhedron (which is an active area of research for many polytopes), but it always works. An example of this process for a regular, 3D cube can be found [here](https://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/projects/tetra/).

</p>

So, I started with a 4D polychoron, whose "faces" (i.e. "cells") are themselves convex polyhedra embedded in 4-dimensions. One by one, I "tetrahedralized" each cell. Together, the sum of these tetrahedra formed the desired 4-dimensional mesh. For example, the hypercube has 8 cells, each of which is a cube (this is why the hypercube is called the 8-cell). Each cube produces 6 distinct tetrahedra, so all together, the tetrahedral decomposition of the hypercube results in 48 tetrahedra. This process can be seen below for an icosahedron in 3-space:

</p>

Regardless of the way in which the polychora are generated, one question remains: what is the importance of maintaining tetrahedral facets? It turns out that slicing a tetrahedron in 4-dimensions is much simpler than slicing the full cells that bound the polychoron. In particular, a sliced tetrahedron (embedded in 4-dimensions) will always produce zero, 3, or 4 vertices, which makes things quite a bit easier (particularly, when it comes to computing vertex indices for OpenGL rendering).

### Implementation of the Slicing Procedure

Each mesh in `polychora` maintains a GPU-side buffer that holds all of its tetrahedra (each of which is an array of 4 vertices). The slicing operation is performed via a compute shader that ultimately generates a new set of vertices (the "slice") for each tetrahedron. The same compute shader also generates draw commands on the GPU, which are later dispatched via `glMultiDrawArraysIndirect`. Essentially, each tetrahedron will generate its own unique draw command that renders either 0, 1, or 2 triangles, depending on whether the slicing operation returned an empty intersection (0), a single triangle (1), or a quad (2). 

In the case where a tetrahedron's slice is a quad, care needs to be taken in order to ensure a proper vertex winding order. This too is handled in the compute shader: the 4 vertices are sorted based on their signed angle with the polygon's normal. This is accomplished via a simple insertion sort. In GLSL, this looks something like:

```glsl
uint i = 1;
while(i < array.length())
{
    uint j = i;
    while(j > 0 && (array[j - 1] > array[j]))
    {
        vec2 temp = array[j];
        array[j] = array[j - 1];
        array[j - 1] = temp;

        j--;
    }
    i++;
}
```

NOTE: this project will only run on graphics cards that support OpenGL [Direct State Access](https://www.khronos.org/opengl/wiki/Direct_State_Access) (DSA) and C++17.

## To Build

1. Clone this repo and initialize submodules: 
```shell
git submodule init
git submodule update
```
2. From the root directory, run the following commands:
```shell
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
```
3. Open the project file for your IDE of choice (generated above)
4. Build and run the project

## To Use

`polychora` currently supports all 5 regular polychora - 8-cell, 16-cell, 24-cell, 120-cell, 600-cell - as well as several uniform polychora.

To rotate the camera around the object in 3-space, press + drag the left mouse button. You can zoom the camera in or out using the scroll wheel.

There are 6 possible plane rotations in a 4-space (see `maths.h` for more details), and these are exposed to the user by 6 float sliders. There is also a toggle for changing between wireframe and filled modes.

Finally, you can toggle between 3 different projections / draw "modes" by repeatedly pressing `t`:
1. Slices: show the 3-dimensional slice of each polychoron, as dictated by the aforementioned "slicing hyperplane"
2. Tetrahedral wireframes: show the 3-dimensional projection of the 4-dimensional tetrahedral decomposition of each polychoron
3. Skeleton: show the 3-dimensional projection of the wireframe of the 4-dimensional polychoron 

All of the draw modes listed above will be affected by the 4-dimensional rotations mentioned prior.

## To Do

- [ ] Add 4-dimensional "extrusions" (i.e. things like spherinders)
- [ ] Add "hollow"-cell variants of each polytope (see Miegakure)
- [ ] Research 4-dimensional knots, un-tying, un-boxing, etc.
- [ ] Add simple lighting (calculate 3D normals after slicing procedure)
- [ ] Research Munsell color solids

## Future Directions

"T" (the author of Eusebeia, mentioned below) recommended the "double description method" for computing higher-dimensional convex hulls. This algorithm is implemented in the [cddlib](https://github.com/cddlib/cddlib) library and supposedly produces more geometrically accurate results. "T" also mentioned that many convex hull algorithms (including QHull) will "triangulate" the output, breaking it into n-dimensional simplices during execution. Since a 4-simplex is a tetrahedron, this makes the slicing procedure relatively straightforward. However, the resulting topology usually doesn't feel as "clean" as the output that I initially generated by manually tetrahedralizing the mesh. This might be because the resulting tetrahedra don't necessarily have uniform volume / size. Disabling the `Qt` triangulation flag in QHull would likely produce a set of non-simplical facet cells, which could be tetrahedralized manually using the aforementioned procedure, but this requires further investigation. How does Miegakure generate its meshes?

Marc Ten Bosch (the author of Miegakure) has written extensively on the topic of geometric algebra, particularly rotors and bivectors. These are alternate (more intuitive?) ways of representing orientation in n-dimensions. In the future, I would love to explore this topic, as well as [rigid body dynamics in 4-space](https://marctenbosch.com/news/2020/05/siggraph-2020-technical-paper-n-dimensional-rigid-body-dynamics/).

## Credits

The idea to use a convex hull algorithm came from "T," the author of [Eusebeia](http://eusebeia.dyndns.org/4d/). Their site is one of the most amazing resources on higher-dimensional rendering. Throughout the early stages of this project, "T" answered many of my (probably dumb) questions and provided a great deal of help and guidance.
